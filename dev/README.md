Dev Folder
=========

## Purpose
This folder is for files that Concordia does not require to run, but you may find useful for modifying game behaviour. 

If you are porting Concordia to a new platform or using it as a base for your own project, you may find these files handy. However, the game does not require any file within this folder to operate.

These files are provided without documentation, support, or warranty of any kind.
