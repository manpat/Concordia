Project BlueBear
================

Version 0.0.2a - Milestone "ET2"

# Introduction

**Project BlueBear** is a virtual dollhouse for PC and Linux. Construct your dream house, place your dolls within, and watch your family grow to success!

## Features

* Dolls featuring artificial intelligence: can you guide their lives better than they can, or do you prefer to let them live hands-off?
* Scenarios for your household: start off healthy, wealthy and privileged...or disabled, poor, and minority. Your life experience is dictated by the family you create and the traits you select in each individual doll!
* Select any one of your dolls and accompany them to work: guide your household to success within any one of seven career paths!
* Tend to their physical well-being by fulfilling five motive groups, and their emotional well-being in one of four personal aspirations. They can't do it alone!
* Extend the game and its features with the **BlueBear Construction Kit**: create new scenarios, needs & wants, dolls, traits, objects, and so much more!

## Technical Highlights

* This game's for the hacker in all of us. With clean, elegantly crafted, annotated source: readability is job #1. Consider any arcane code to be a bug.
* Lua 5.3 scripting system: everything the game uses outside of its base structure as a dollhouse game is designed as an extensible script (e.g. all objects and types of objects are defined as Lua classes)
* Isometric, sprite-based 2.5D presentation with a retro-inspired pixel art look-and-feel
* SFML-powered multimedia framework featuring the SFGUI widget toolkit
* Multi-threaded architecture, using modern C++14 to make the most of your multi-core CPU
